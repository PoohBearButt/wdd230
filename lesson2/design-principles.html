            <p>What they do well in their website design is to use the colors of their logo to create repetition with their background and accents of the webpage styling.</p>

            <p>They do well with the use of clean design and use of whitespaces. For every section that they want to give an explanation, it is not too big or long and they use their fun graphic design to balance the size of the text. All around them, there is enough whitespace to balance the area where content has taken up space. This is done in such a way that it is easy to view visually.  They cleverly used a greater amount of whitespace to indicate when a new reading section begins and ends.</p>

            <p>The site has great contrast shown to make things easy to look at. They use white text on dark pictures and backgrounds. Meanwhile, dark text is used on lighter photos and backgrounds. As you go further down the webpage, you can see that other various colors are used to create interest and still give contrast to the basic colors of black, white, and grey used in the text and background.</p>
